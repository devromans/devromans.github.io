Hello, friend! :wave: My name is Roman Shopin, and I’m thrilled to welcome you to my blog.
Here, I share my thoughts, experiences, ideas, and personal notes — it's more of a personal corner for reflection.

I’ve been working in IT :man_technologist: since 2012, focusing on Solution Architecture.

I’m originally from Ukraine :ukraine: :hearts: and have been living in the Netherlands :netherlands: since 2022.
(One day, I’ll share the story of my migration with you.)

Since 2024, I’ve been working at [Saint-Gobain Sekurit Service](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sekurit-service/),
and before that, I spent a wonderful 7 years at [Spryker](https://spryker.com/).
