![Roman Shopin](/about/images/author.webp "Photo from the old life")

Hi there :waving_hand:, my name is Roman Shopin. Since 2022 living in the Netherlands :netherlands:, but originally 
I'm from Ukrane :ukraine: (maybe at some day I will tell you the story about my migration).

I'm PHP developer since 2012. Currently working at [Spryker](https://spryker.com/).
