Glad to see you here :smiley:. It's my first blog post and I hope in the future you will see more interesting
stuff here.

I started it mostly because of curiosity about Static Site Generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Having played enough with these generators, I realized that having a personal blog might be a good idea as I began to
forget events and stories from my life which I prefer to remember.

Who knows how this will go, hope to see you again in the nearest future.
